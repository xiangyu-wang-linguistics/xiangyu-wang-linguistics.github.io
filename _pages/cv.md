## Research Experience

**Individual Project** - *Evaluating LSTM Models in Simulating Infant Acquisition of Function Words: A Surprisal-Based Approach to Predicting Age of Acquisition from Child-Directed Speech* | 01/2024 – 04/2024

- *Objective*: To compare the performance of LSTM models with N-gram models in predicting the acquisition of function words in infants, evaluated through surprisal metrics and age of acquisition predictions.

**Individual Project** - *The Distributional Contexts of Known Words in Child-Directed Speech Matters* | 09/2023 – 12/2023

- *Objective*: Investigate the predictive power of the distribution of known words on early vocabulary acquisition in both American English and British English speaking children.
- Utilized stringr for data curation to include only CHAT files comprising caregiver speech directed at children no older than 30 months.
- Tokenized and standardized child-directed speech by separating utterances into words.
- Computed statistics for individual CDI words across filtered CHAT files.
- Analyzed frequent syntactic frames of target CDI words in North American English and British English CHAT files.
- Implemented Pro-KWo (Flores et al., 2023) for assessing co-occurrence frequencies of words within the known lexicon of children at specific ages.

**Individual Project** - *Degree of Embodiment in Processing Verb Metaphors: comparing L1 English speakers with L1 Chinese-L2 English speakers* | 02/2023 – 05/2023

- Explored how visual cues of verbs' base meanings affect the comprehension of their metaphorical uses.
- Created experimental materials using image databases, cross-referenced with psycholinguistic scales.
- Based hypotheses on Paivio's dual coding theory (1991) and concluded through Repeated Measures ANOVA that visual cues enhance metaphor processing for both L1 and L2 English speakers.

**Individual Project** - *Career Attitudes and Engagement Questionnaire Development, Validation, and Investigation* | 02/2023 – 05/2023

- Employed the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to examine career-enhancing behaviors among undergraduate psychology students in UK universities.
- Performed item vetting and analysis to ensure the reliability and validity of the questionnaire, resulting in a five-scale instrument based on TPB.
- Conducted factor analysis and constructed hierarchical regression models using SPSS.

**Individual Project** - *Processing of Reflexive Pronouns Ziji/X-self in L1 Chinese-L2 English Speakers* | 09/2022 – 12/2022

- Investigated the influence of subject orientation in Mandarin Chinese on the interpretation of verb anaphora and reading time differences.
- Adapted experimental items for VP-Ellipsis contexts and conducted self-paced reading tasks using PsychoPy.
- Analyzed data using Linear Mixed-Effects models with the lme4 package in R.
