Hello! My name is Xiangyu Wang (/ɕjɑŋ.y wɑŋ/).

I am a second-year MA student in Linguistics at the University of Oxford. My research interests are in syntax, semantics, and language acquisition. Broadly, I am interested in how patterns predicted by syntactic and semantic theory surface not only in controlled, linguist-trimmed datasets, but also in large-scale corpora and in (developing) minds.

Methodologically, I work at the theory–experiment interface: I start from structures and inferences licensed by syntax and formal semantics, and then ask how these theoretical possibilities show up with potentially different effect sizes in acquisition and processing.

Currently I am working on an intensifier-derived analysis of Mandarin ziji, topic and focus Mandarin child-directed speech, focus processing, and verb-doubling. Details coming soon!
